# Other codes not listed above may be available for additional keys,
# depending on operating system and libraries used to compile Lynx.
# On some systems, if compiled with recent versions of slang or ncurses
# (if macro USE_KEYMAPS was in effect during compilation), an additional
# level of key mapping is supported via an external ".lynx-keymaps" file.
# This file, if found in the home directory at startup, will always be
# used under those conditions; see lynx-keymaps distributed in the samples
# subdirectory for further explanation.  Note that mapping via
# .lynx-keymaps, if applicable, is a step that logically comes before the
# mappings done here: KEYMAP maps the result of that step (which still
# represents a key) to a function (which represents an action that Lynx
# should perform).

#
#KEYMAP:O:TOGGLE_HELP		# Show other commands in the novice help menu
#
# KEYMAP lines can have one or two additional fields.  The extended format is
#  KEYMAP:<KEYSTROKE>:[<MAIN LYNX FUNCTION>]:<OTHER BINDING>[:<SELECT>]
#
# If the additional field OTHER BINDING specifies DIRED, then the function is
# mapped in the override table used only in DIRED mode.  This is only valid
# if lynx was compiled with dired support and OK_OVERRIDE defined.  A
# MAIN LYNX FUNCTION must be given (it should of course be one that makes
# sense in Dired mode), and SELECT is meaningless.  Default built-in override
# mappings are
#
#KEYMAP:^U:PREV_DOC:DIRED	# Return to the previous document
#KEYMAP:.:TAG_LINK:DIRED	# Tag a file or directory for later action
#KEYMAP:c:CREATE:DIRED		# Create a new file or directory
#KEYMAP:C:CHDIR:DIRED		# change current directory
#KEYMAP:f:DIRED_MENU:DIRED	# Display a menu of file operations
#KEYMAP:m:MODIFY:DIRED		# Modify name or location of a file or directory
#KEYMAP:r:REMOVE:DIRED		# Remove files or directories
#KEYMAP:t:TAG_LINK:DIRED	# Tag a file or directory for later action
#KEYMAP:u:UPLOAD:DIRED		# Show menu of "Upload Options"
#
# If the OTHER BINDING field does not specify DIRED, then it is taken as a
# line-editor action.  It is possible to keep the MAIN LYNX FUNCTION field
# empty in that case, for changing only the line-editing behavior.
# If alternative line edit styles are compiled in, and modifying a key's
# line-editor binding on a per style basis is possible, then SELECT can be
# used to specify which styles are affected.  By default, or if SELECT is
# 0, all line edit styles are affected.  If SELECT is a positive integer
# number, only the binding for the numbered style is changed (numbering
# is in the order in which styles are shown in the Options Menu, starting
# with 1 for the Default style).  If SELECT is negative (-n), all styles
# except n are affected.

# If OTHER BINDING specifies PASS, then if the key is pressed in a text input
# field it is passed by the built-in line-editor to normal KEYMAP handling,

# behavior of the key).  For example,
#KEYMAP:0x10C:UP_TWO:PASS # Function key Insert - Move display up two lines
#
# Other examples (repeating built-in bindings)
#KEYMAP:^V::LKCMD	# set (only) line-edit action for ^V
#KEYMAP:^V:SWITCH_DTD:LKCMD # set main lynxaction and line-edit action for ^V
#KEYMAP:^U::ERASE:1	# set line-edit binding for ^U, for default style
#KEYMAP:^[::SETM2:3	# use escape key as modifier - works only sometimes
